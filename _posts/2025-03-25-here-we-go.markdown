Oh my, well, a project like this has been going on for nearly half a century, give or take. And I keep having thoughts. Thoughts about life, God, work, play, kids, friends... It's pretty all-encompassing. At times, it helps to write what I am thinking through. In the writing comes organization and clarity, and then it's a lot easier to make sense of.

So here's where I'll try to make sense of it all...  Just getting the blog software set up. It's Jekyll and I'll likely be using GitHub Pages (thanks GitHub!).
